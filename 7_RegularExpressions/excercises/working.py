# In a file called working.py,
# implement a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats
# below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format
# (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00).
# Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein)
# and that there will be a space before each.
# Assume that these times are representative of actual times,
# not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.

# 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM
# 9 AM to 5 PM
# Raise a ValueError instead if the input to convert is not in either of those formats
# or if either time is invalid (e.g., 12:60 AM, 13:00 PM, etc.).
# But do not assume that someoneâ€™s hours will start ante meridiem
# and end post meridiem; someone might work late and even long hours
# (e.g., 5:00 PM to 9:00 AM).
